## The King o’ Crabs

Captain Kitty One Ear raised a spyglass, scanning the horizon with her one sharp, ever watchful, calculating eye. The waves of the Caribbean Sea rolled lazily; the scent of salt and sun thick in the air. Then – movement! Kitty grinned, whiskers twitching. “Hmm. Dinner”, Kitty said to herself, licking her lips as she spotted a lone pigeon which was quickly flying towards The Mango Mirage.
 
As the pigeon fluttered closer, Kitty’s tail flicked, her claws flexing, ready to strike. She crouched low, muscles coiling, her eyes locked on the prize. The bird dipped, hovering just above the ship’s deck when…
 
“Waiiiit, Cap’n!”, First Mate Blue urgently shouted, shattering Kitty’s focus. Mid-pounce, she froze, glaring at the blue iguana.
 
“Blue, ya best have a mighty good reason for stoppin’ me dinner,” she growled.
 
The lizard jerked his head toward the bird’s leg. “Cap’n, dis be a messenger pigeon! Look ya. See dat paper pon its leg? Dat message mus’ be for ya!”
 
Kitty’s one ear perked, her claws retreating. Dinner? No. This was something bigger. Something urgent.
 
She gently removed the message from the pigeon’s leg, eyes narrowing as she read. Then Kitty’s expression hardened, her fur bristling with determination.
 
“Me breddren, Mary - she need we help”, Kitty muttered. Then her voice rang loud and sharp, cutting through the Caribbean air like a blade. “Haul up dem sails me scurvy crew, an’ set course for Grand Cayman!”
 
The Mango Mirage surged forward, its sails billowing, straining against the fierce grip of the Caribbean winds. The rigging groaned, taut as a bowstring, as gusts snatched at the golden sails, driving the ship faster than it had ever dared before. Beneath the hull, the ocean churned and foamed, each wave shattered by the prow’s relentless charge.
 
Crew members clung to the rails, their faces whipped by salt-spray, their voices almost lost in the roaring wind. First Mate Blue barked orders as his claws scrambled to keep the ship’s captains-wheel steady. The Mango Mirage pitched and rolled, but Kitty stood firm at the helm, her ginger fur slick with fine sea spray; her eye locked on the horizon. Kitty knew Mary was waiting, and nothing - not the howling wind, not the raging sea - would slow The Mango Mirage from reaching her.
 
When Kitty arrived, Mary Ebanks was waiting for them at The Driftway Slip near to The Golden Mango Grove. Mary immediately described how her brother, George, had been fishing when he caught a small crab on his line. Almost immediately, hundreds of crabs sprung from the sea, covering George before dragging him into the sea. There was nothing Mary could do but watch in horror.
 
“Cap’n, dis feel like dark magic, ya know”, said First Mate Blue.
 
“Aye”, growled Kitty. “Only one creature got de answers we need. We gotta summon de King o’ Crabs.” Mary could see the crew of The Mango Mirage shudder with fear at the mention of The King of Crabs.
 
“Bring me de Horn o’ Neptune,” said Kitty. “Ain’t no sea creature can fight its call - not even de King o’ Crabs.”
 
“How ya come by de Horn o’ Neptune, eh? Ya been tiefin’ again, Kitty?” asked Mary with a scowl.
 
“When me ever tief, eh?”, replied Kitty with a wicked grin.
 
As First Mate Blue brought Kitty the Horn of Neptune, The Mango Mirage set out to sea once more. Eventually, they anchored by a small island, covered in trees, close to the undersea Kingdom of the crabs.
 
As Kitty blew the horn, the blast pierced the air, rolling out over the waves like the call of some ancient force. For a moment, the ocean was still, holding its breath. Then... chaos!
 
The sea churned and boiled, frothing as something colossal stirred from beneath. At first, a single jointed limb - a pereiopod, long as a mast - surged from the depths, glistening with seawater and tangled kelp. Then another. And another! Each limb clawed for purchase, gripping The Mango Mirage’s hull, making the ship lurch and groan under their monstrous weight.
 
The crew of wild chickens squawked in alarm, clinging to whatever they could as the deck pitched, their beaked faces whipped by mist and fear.
 
Then came the claws. One massive, crushing claw the colour of volcanic rock rose high, towering above the ship. A second, slightly smaller, snapped open and shut as if tasting the salty air. And then - two eyes appeared!
 
Twin, bulbous orbs burst through the surface, glowing like molten gold, scanning the crew with ancient, unreadable judgment. His mandibles clicked, a sound like splintering bone, and from deep within his armoured throat came a thunderous bellow, rumbling through the very bones of the ship.
“WHO CALL UPON DE KING o’ CRABS?!”
 
“Me,” said Kitty One Ear, her tail bristling with courage. “Now, tell me - why ya gone an’ snatch up George Ebanks?”
 
“HE DARED TO CATCH ME LIKKLE SON. SO, I DONE CAPTURE HIM IN RETURN!”, roared The King of Crabs.
 
Kitty narrowed her eye, her whiskers twitchin’. “But he ain’t mean no harm. So why not let de man go?”
 
“NO. NOT UNLESS YA PROVE YA WORTH IN A TEST O’ SPEED AN’ SEA!”
 
The King of Crabs challenged Kitty to a race. Kitty would have to travel over the small island, and The King of Crabs would travel around it by sea. Whoever got to the other side of the island would win.
 
And so, Kitty bravely accepted The King of Crabs’ challenge, which was to begin at dawn the next day.
 
“Cap’n, dat island is full up wid trees!” squawked Henrietta Feathers. “Ain’t no way ya get through in time!”
 
“How ya plan ta win dis race, eh?”, asked Mary, brows furrowed.
 
Kitty grinned, tail flicking slyly. “Easy. He say I gotta go over de island, na true? So, ya gon’ ta blast me over de island from de ship’s cannon!” Mary's eyes went wide.
 
Kitty quickly turned to First Mate Blue. “Blue, ya an’ de crew, get to work! Stitch me up a parachute from one o’ dem sails. Move quick, we ain’t got much time!”
 
The crew worked all night. As the sun began to rise, Kitty One Ear clambered into the cannon, wearing half a coconut as a helmet and the parachute made of the ship’s sails attached securely to her back. The sea boiled and churned once more. The Mango Mirage rocked wildly, near tossing its crew into the waves, as The King of Crabs rose once more from de depths.
 
“YA READY FI DIS RACE, LIL’ PIRATE?!”, he bellowed, his voice shaking the sky and sea alike. Then before Kitty could reply, The King of Crabs dove deep into the ocean, sending a mighty wave which crashed against The Mango Mirage, rocking it even harder! First Mate Blue lit the fuse for the cannon.
 
Kitty sucked in a breath. The world held still. Then…
 
BOOM!
 
The cannon erupted, shaking the very bones of The Mango Mirage. A cloud of smoke and fire burst into the sky, and at its heart – brave Captain Kitty One Ear, hurtling through the air like a mango pit flung from a hungry sailor’s hand.
 
Wind snatched at her fur, her half-coconut helmet rattling against Kitty’s ear. The island rushed beneath Kitty, a blur of green jungle and golden sand, spinning as she tumbled through the sky.
“Wha’ in de name o’ sea monsters did I jus’ do?!” she yowled, claws flailing.
 
Below, The King of Crabs surged through the waves, his massive claws slicing through the water like twin blades. He was fast - too fast!
 
Kitty gritted her teeth. No turning back now. She yanked at the ropes strapped to her back. The makeshift parachute - stitched from old sails and pirate ingenuity - snapped open with a mighty WHOOSH. Suddenly, Kitty was floating, the wind cradling her like a mother rocking a restless child. The island spread out beneath her, the finish line just ahead.
 
Below, The King of Crabs bellowed, his golden eyes blazing. “YA TINK YA CLEVER, LIL’ PIRATE?! I GON’ REACH DA BEACH BEFORE YA SNIFF DE SAND!”
 
Kitty snarled, twisting her body to steer. “Not today, ya big ol’ crustacean!” she hollered.
 
As the beach raced toward her, Kitty tucked in her legs, bracing for impact.
 
THUMP! Kitty hit the sand, rolling, tumbling - but upright. A heartbeat later, The King of Crabs crashed onto the shore, his claws digging deep, his mandibles clicking furiously. He stared at Captain Kitty One Ear.  Kitty grinned, breathless, fur wild, coconut helmet tilted. “Beat ya”, she said.
 
For a moment, silence. Then, The King of Crabs threw back his head and laughed; a deep, rumbling sound that shook the palm trees. “FAIR PLAY, PIRATE. YA GOT DE SPEED AN’ DE SMARTS.”
 
With a mighty snap, George Ebanks appeared from thin air and tumbled onto the sand, dazed but grinning. Kitty dusted herself off, tail flicking. “Now, how ‘bout we celebrate wid some mango soup, eh?”
 
Back on deck, Mary squeezed her brother tight, relief flooding her face. The crew passed around second helpings of mango soup, laughter rolling over the waves like the warm Caribbean breeze.
Mary turned to Kitty, eyes shining. “How can I ever repay ya, Kitty?”
 
Kitty wiped the last drop of mango from her whiskers, tail flicking sharp. “Jus’ never fire me outta a cannon again, ya hear?”, she said. Then she leaned in, her wicked grin stretching wide. “Unless, o’ course, dere be treasure waitin’ on de other side.”
 
Henrietta squawked. Blue sighed. Mary burst out laughing.
 
And just like that, The Mango Mirage set sail once more! Captain Kitty chasing adventure, mischief, and maybe even a bit of well-earned trouble.
