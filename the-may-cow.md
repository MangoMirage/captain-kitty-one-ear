## Captain Kitty One Ear and the dreaded May Cow

“Noooooooooo!” The sad cry reverberated through the planks of The Mango Mirage, waking everyone up.

“What is it? What’s up?!”, shouted Captain Kitty One Ear as she rushed onto the deck, still dressed in her yellow pyjamas.

“Cap’n, dat sound come straight from de galley, down below!”, said First Mate Blue, wearing a pink nightcap.

In the galley, Pepperbeak the cook was fluttering all over the place! ““Squawk, squawk!! Dis a whole heap o’ trouble! We done run outta mangoes! How me s’posed to cook up de best mango soup widout mangoes?!”

“Alright, crew! No need to fret! We sail to de nearest mango grove, and tonight—we tief all de mango we can carry!”, said Kitty with a mischievous grin.

Kitty knew exactly where to go… hidden away on the southern coast of Grand Cayman, is the Golden Mango Grove; a legendary place among sailors and islanders alike. Shimmering faintly under the moonlight, the grove is said to be enchanted - its mango trees bear fruit that are richer and sweeter than any others. Some claim the mangoes glow because they absorb the golden rays of the sunset, while others believe it’s a sign of an ancient blessing placed upon the land.

The grove was once carefully tended by an old islander named Cedric Seabreeze, who mysteriously disappeared one stormy night, decades ago. Since then, the grove has been left to nature, thriving wildly under the Cayman skies. Though unattended, the trees still produce endless bounty, and islanders whispered that those who take mangoes without permission may anger the May Cow, the ghostly guardian that roams among the trees at night.

“The May Cow? Who – SQUARK! – is dat?”, asked Pepperbeak.

The eyes of First Mate Blue’s grew wide as he said in a trembling voice, "You lissen, now. May Cow is a duppy – a ghost - wit fierce red eyes dat glow in de night an’ hair black like tar. But dat not all! She got a big ol’ chain hanging from her neck, and dat chain make a terrible jingle-jangle soun’ as she come for ya. If ya hear dat sound, ya run! Else she take ya soul, and ya be lost in de mango trees… forever."

Kitty smiled, shaking her ginger head. "I na scared of no duppy cow. We sail tonight!"

“Cap’n, how we s’posed to haul all dem mangoes?”, asked Henrietta Feathers.

“I gon’ fix up one o’ dem boats wid wheels—make it run ‘pon land an’ sea, same way! What dem call an ‘amphibious boat’ me tinks”, advised Blue.

Kitty knew that they could roll the boat on wheels up the Driftway Slip, which was not far from the grove. The Driftway Slip is a rugged yet well-used slipway carved into the limestone shore. This slip has served generations of seafarers; providing a quiet place to launch boats, haul in fishing catches, and, in whispered circles, conduct secret trades under the cover of darkness. Legend says that Cedric Seabreeze himself used the Driftway Slip to ferry goods to and from the Golden Mango Grove, but after his disappearance, it had gained a reputation as a place for mysterious happenings. At night, the waves rolling against the slipway sometimes made sound like whispers - perhaps the ghosts of old sailors, or just the restless sea calling to those who dare enter the grove?

As darkness descended, Kitty, First Mate Blue, Henrietta Feathers, and Clucky Pete pushed their new amphibious boat from the sea and up along the Driftway Slip. From there it was easy to find their way to the ancient Golden Mango Grove.

Captain Kitty One Ear and her crew lit oil lamps to provide some light as they weaved their way through the grove’s tangled, ancient paths. Shadows danced between gnarled tree trunks, twisted like spectral fingers under the swaying glow. Overhead, thick canopies of mango-laden branches blocked out most of the night sky, save for slivers of silver moonlight that pierced through in quiet defiance of the dark.
 
The air was thick with the scent of ripe fruit - sweet, golden, and heavy with age-old magic. Kitty thought she could hear a soft murmuring carried on the night breeze, as though it were the ghost of Cedric Seabreeze warning them not to proceed. The crew walked carefully, pushing the amphibious boat with them across the uneven ground which was riddled with fallen leaves and roots, twisted like the veins of the earth, threatening to trip the unwary. Their steps were hushed, as if afraid to disturb something older than themselves.

Then a bright light suddenly shone directly into their faces!

“Oi!”, shouted Kitty in alarm.

“Oh, tis you!”, said a familiar voice. The light bright light was switched off instantly, and into the circle of light provided by the oil lamps stepped Mary Ebanks; a friend of Captain Kitty One Ear.

“Mary, me breddren! Wha ya doin’ here?!”, asked Kitty with her eyes wide in surprise.

“I live close by”, explained Mary. ““Saw li’l flickers o’ ya lamp light an’ thought I best come see wha’ goin’ on.”

“Alright, ya know now. So go on, back ta ya bed, nice an’ easy”, Kitty said, her voice sweet but firm.

“I’m na goin’ to bed until you tell me what you all doin’ here!”, said Mary hotly. Then Mary narrowed her eyes and said, “Kitty, ya know better than to tief fruit that ain’t yours”

Kitty shrugged, flashing a sly grin. “Mangoes grow back, so wha’ harm be done? An’ tell me dis, girl - ain’t survivin’ at sea ‘bout takin’ what ya need?”

Mary was just about to argue, saying that local people may rely upon the mango harvest to survive, when… they heard it. A row rumble at first. Then the faint sound of hooves striking the earth and the clear jingle-jangle clanking of rusted old chain. The grove seemed to hold its breath. Kitty, Mary, and crew suddenly realised that they were not alone. The May Cow was coming for them!

 “Ruuuuun!”, screamed Kitty!

As they ran, the crew stayed true to their mission, quickly pushing the amphibious boat back towards the Driftway Slip, grabbing mangoes, left and right, from the trees and dropping them into the boat. Mary ran with them, half scared to death!

The trouble was, Kitty and her crew were so concentrated on running away from the May Cow while gathering fruit, they forget to look where they were going. They took a wrong turn and ran uptowards a cliff rather than downwards, towards the Driftway Slip.

Suddenly, the mango grove ended and the cliff loomed before them. With the pounding hooves of the May Cow rapidly catching up to the crew, Kitty knew there was only one option – “Everyone, jump in de boat!”, she screamed as the speeding boat rolled off the edge of the cliff.

Everyone screamed as they felt themselves plunging towards to crashing waves of the sea.

SPLASH!! The boat hit the water and immediately started to sink!

“No, no, no!”, wailed Kitty! “All dem mangoes gon’ be lost to de sea!”

But – pop, pop, pop – one by one, the mangoes re-surfaced from beneath the waves. Kitty breathed a sigh of relief and Mary said, “Quick, each of you - hold onto a Mango to help you float back The Mango Mirage.”

Thankfully, The Mango Mirage was anchored nearby so it didn’t take long for Captain Kitty, Mary, First Mate Blue, Henrietta Feathers and Clucky Pete to float to safety. As Kitty and her crew wrapped themselves in dry blankets, the rest of the crew used fishing nets to haul-in the rest of the floating mangos.

The fierce red eyes of the May Cow watched the crew, as hot steam bellowed from its huge nostrils. The May Cow could go no further than the cliff since it was bound by magic to forever remain in the Golden Mango Grove as it’s guardian.

Onboard ship, Pepperbeak made a fresh batch of steaming hot golden mango soup which all the crew and Mary enjoyed while sitting around brightly burning braziers. Wide eyes and much laughter unfolded as Kitty told the rest of the crew about their near escape from the fierce May Cow.

Eventually, the sun began to rise and Kitty rowed a sleepy Mary back to shore, making sure she got home all right. Onshore they said their goodbyes and as Kitty started to walk away, she turned and tossed a mango to Mary. Mary caught the mango, looking surprised. With a wink, Kitty said, "Na worry, Mary. A gift - not stolen, this time!" And, with a chuckle, Kitty rowed back to The Mango Mirage and her adventurous life on the high seas.
