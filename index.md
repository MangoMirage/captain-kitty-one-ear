# 🏴‍☠️ The Captain’s Cove

*Recovered from the salt-stained journals of a one-eared feline pirate, these tales are not for the hurried reader. They are for those who listen to the wind, question the stars, and know that rebellion often wears a grin.*

Welcome to **The Captain’s Cove**, a quiet archive of stories from Captain Kitty One Ear - feline wanderer, maritime mischief-maker, and gentle rebel. These tales are offered without commentary, without applause. They are yours to read, ponder, and carry with you.
