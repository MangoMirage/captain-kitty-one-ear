## The Island of Chihuahua’s

Under a golden sun, the crew of Captain Kitty One Ear sprawled lazily across the deck of The Mango Mirage, basking in the warmth of the day.

Captain Kitty swooped down from the rigging. THUD! Her peg-leg slammed onto the deck, jolting the crew of wild chickens awake with a flurry of flying feathers.

“Avast, me hearties!” Kitty roared. “Adventure be a-callin’!”

“Tell us more”, said First Mate Blue as he popped his tricorn hat onto his scaly head.

“Dis right here," Kitty said, unfolding an old, crinkled bit of paper, "be a magical map, showin’ de way to secret islands - hidden so deep, no regular sailor ever find dem. Each island hold a piece o’ somethin’ big, an’ when we put dem all together… well, me hearties, we talkin’ treasure beyond imagination!”

And so, the sails of The Mango Mirage were unfurled and the ship was soon skipping along the rolling waves of the Caribbean Sea.

With Kitty at the helm of The Mango Mirage, it wasn’t long before Henrietta Feathers shouted, “LAND AHOY!”, as she spotted the first mysterious island. As Kitty’s ship lay anchored in a cove, the Captain, Clucky Pete, and First Mate Blue rowed ashore.

Walking up the beach, they soon came across a sign on the tree-line which said, “Beware! Land of the Chihuahua’s!” and they heard barking, not too far away. Clucky Pete, and First Mate Blue exchanged a nervous glance as the barking increased.

"Cap’n, dis place don’t feel right, ya know? Chihuahuas be small… but dis kinda bark ain’t normal!"

Kitty laughed. "Ah, ye tink I be ‘fraid of a few little doggies? Please! I take on storms an’ sea monsters fer fun! Chihuahua’s… dey so tiny, dey only bite ankles."

Then, the tall trees were forced apart from one another to make way for three HUGE chihuahua’s who looked down at poor Kitty and her crew – this was the island of giant chihuahua’s!

“I am the Grand Pupper!”, boomed the middle chihuahua. “And this is Duchess Lili the Fierce, and Balthazar the Howler”

“Who are you little creatures? And what do you want?”, snarled Duchess Lili the Fierce.

“I am Captain Kitty One Ear,” said Kitty bravely, bowing low as she swept her hat from her ginger head. “We looking for de firs’ magical item dat will lead us to treasure beyond imagination.”

“You must mean the Golden Chew-Toy!”, howled Balthazar the Howler. “That is our most treasured possession. And only the most-fierce may have it.”

“I am pretty fierce”, said Kitty as she extended her sharp claws for all to see.

“Are you fierce enough to compete in a Bark-off?”, growled Duchess Lili the Fierce. “If you win, you can have the Golden Chew-toy. But if you lose, you and your crew will be dropped into the Pit of Poop!”

“Ohhhh, lemme do dis!”, said Clucky Pete as he jumped up and down. “I was raised wid de finest barkers! Watch an’ learn!" 

Before a startled Kitty could object, Clucky Pete took a deep breath and screamed, “COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO!!”

“That’s not a bark!”, said the Grand Pupper with an angry frown upon his face.

 “Err, yes it is! It’s called a chicken-bark!”, said an embarrassed Kitty.

“A chicken-bark? Hah! Now I done heard everything!", snarled Duchess Lili the Fierce. “You have one last chance, my dear Captain… otherwise you and your crew will be sinking up to your necks the Pit of Poop!”

So, Kitty braced herself… and from the bottom of her pirate boots she gave the biggest bark she could!

“Is that all?”, said Duchess Lili the Fierce, unimpressed. Just then, Kitty’s tiny body convulsed with a Herculean effort and her eyes bulged as if she had just seen a ghost tap-dancing on the kitchen table. And then – COUGH, COUGH! SPLAT! Out of Kitty’s mouth shot a gooey, tangled, big ginger hair-ball!

For a moment, the giant chihuahua’s just stood there, staring at Kitty in shocked silence… and then they started rolling around with laughter!

“Oh, my!”, said the Grand Pupper, wiping tears from his eyes. “That is the funniest thing I have seen in years! You definitely win, Kitty!”

Kitty purred with pride as Duchess Lili the Fierce scowled and growled. Balthazar the Howler brought the sacred Golden Chew-Toy to Kitty, and Kitty bowed low as she graciously accepted it.

Kitty and her crew returned to their ship, which was still gently bobbing where they had left it, anchored in the island cove.

“Where will we sail to next, Captain?”, asked First Mate Blue.

Kitty looked as a new island appeared on the magical map, glowing mysteriously. “Here!”, said Kitty,
pointing to the island with one of her sharp claws. “Onward sail, me hearties! De treasure ain’t gonna find itself!”

As the golden sails of The Mango Mirage caught the Caribbean winds, Kitty and her crew sped on to their next adventure, looking for the treasure beyond imagination!
