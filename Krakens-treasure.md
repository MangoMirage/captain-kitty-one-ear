## Captain Kitty One Ear and the Kraken’s Treasure

“Are we dere yet?” sighed George, brushing another broad leaf out of his face. Being deep in the tropical heart of Grand Cayman — parrots screeching overhead, the air thick with heat and the smell of earth — had stopped feeling adventurous about twenty minutes ago. If he’d wanted excitement, there were perfectly good computer games waiting for him at home.

“Now, now,” chuckled his Grandpa, known to everyone as Old Ebanks. “Treasure huntin’ ain’t easy… and it surely ain’t for the faint hearted.”

“Yeah, get some backbone,” Mary teased, giving George a playful punch on the arm. “Just imagine de riches we might find!”

“Or de scratches from all dese branches…” George muttered.

Mary’s mind drifted back to that morning — to the way Old Ebanks had burst into the kitchen, waving a bottle he’d found while fishing near Stingray City. Inside was a map, sealed with wax stamped by… a paw print. A cat’s paw print.

Old Ebanks had been so excited he could barely speak, and the joy in his eyes had been enough for Mary and George to agree to the adventure, even if they didn’t believe a word of it.
But now, as George’s enthusiasm wilted, Old Ebanks’ only seemed to grow. Every step toward the big red ‘X’ on the map made him walk a little faster.

“It’s just beyond dese trees,” he said, squinting at the map through his spectacles, finger jabbing ahead.

Mary hurried forward, pushing aside a curtain of glossy green leaves — and froze.

She had never seen anything like it.

A cluster of wild chickens stood around a freshly dug hole, all peering down into it. But these weren’t ordinary chickens. Brown, black, white — even blue and yellow — each wore a colourful bandana tied around its head, and several sported tiny piratical sashes across their feathery chests.

And in the hole itself…

A cat stood waist deep in the earth, shovel in her paws. She wore a bright red coat with wide, frayed white cuffs, and buttons so shiny they sparkled in the midday sun. Her ginger fur glowed, her single ear twitched, and her eye patch gave her a look of fierce determination.

She purred with satisfaction. “We’ve found it, me hearties… the Kraken’s treasure, at last!”

“A talking cat?” George whispered.

“A *pirate* talking cat,” Mary corrected, eyes wide.

Everything went still. Then, slowly, the cat and her band of chickens turned to face the newcomers. A blue iguana wearing a tricorn hat poked his head above the edge of the hole, squinting suspiciously with one of his two eyes.

The cat’s voice rolled out, thick with Caymanian rhythm and mischief. “What you doin’ fishin’ in these waters?”

With a single graceful leap, she sprang out of the hole, swept up a tattered skull and crossbones hat from the ground, and set it smartly on her head. Mary’s eyes went wide as she saw the cat was missing one leg – in its place was a wooden leg, beautifully polished, with what looked to be gold and bejewelled decorations, and a steel tip where the foot should be.

Mary swallowed. “Who… who are you?”

The cat grinned, sharp teeth gleaming. “I be Captain Kitty One Ear — scourge of the seven seas.”
She leaned in, tail flicking. “And my question still stands… what ye be lookin’ for in these here waters?”

Old Ebanks started to hide the treasure map behind his back. But Mary took it gently from his hand and stepped forward toward Captain Kitty and this strange feathery crew. Mary's heart thudded, but she lifted her chin. If she wanted answers, she’d have to meet this head on.

“We have a map that says there’s treasure here,” Mary said.

In three swift, silent steps, Captain Kitty was beside her. Mary startled — the cat moved like a shadow — but Mary held her ground.

“May I…?” asked the corsair cat, extending a paw. “Lemme see dat.”

Mary hesitated only a moment before handing it over. Kitty’s good eye flicked up, as if noting the courage it took. There was something about this young human – courage and bravado overcoming a natural sense of fear – that reminded Kitty so much of herself.

The pirate scanned the map and grinned. “Hah! Did you find this in a bottle sealed with a paw print in wax?”

“It’s yours,” Mary said.

“Aye, true as tide. Storm did tear it from me paws.” Kitty tapped her temple. “But I keep de whole ting up here… an’ now look — we all out here diggin’ holes like land crabs in mating season, chasin’ de same treasure.”

George bristled. “We found the map — it’s ours!”

“Ah, de rule of finders keepers don’ hold true here, my boy. An’ look ’round you…” Mary heard the chickens’ low, menacing clucks. “I’d say you well outnumbered.”

George muttered something about deep fried chicken, but Kitty cut in smoothly.

“Tell ye what — help us, and ye can join me crew. We’ll take ye to me ship, The Mango Mirage, introduce ye to the mates… and Pepperbeak’ll cook up a fresh pot of mango soup.”

Mary’s mind spun. Pepperbeak? The Mango Mirage? Mango soup? And the Kraken’s treasure?

“Deal!” she said before Old Ebanks or George could object.

Captain Kitty One Ear held out her paw. Mary shook it, solemn and steady. Kitty’s grin softened into something almost warm.

Mary didn’t know why, but she felt it — a spark of trust in this outlandish feline.

For the next forty minutes, Kitty, Mary, and George deepened the hole while Old Ebanks chortled and chatted with the chickens beneath the shade of a tree. Sweat trickled down Mary’s back, but she noticed George beginning to enjoy himself — the way he leaned into the rhythm of digging, the way he kept glancing at Kitty’s peg leg as if imagining one of his own.

And then… THUNK.

Kitty’s spade struck something solid.

In an instant, the three of them were scraping away soil as the chickens and Old Ebanks hurried over.
“Eh eh… would you look at dat,” Old Ebanks breathed as the curved lid of a treasure chest emerged from the earth.

Kitty hesitated only a heartbeat before flinging the lid open. A blaze of gold and jewels burst into the clearing, so bright that several chickens shielded their eyes with their wings.

Captain Kitty whooped with delight, spinning on her peg leg. The chickens clucked a merry tune, Old Ebanks joined in, and even George attempted a jig. But Mary’s grin slowly faded. A scrap of parchment lay among the treasure, edges torn, the writing dark and rusty.
Kitty noticed first. “What be wrong, me breddren?”

“This note,” Mary whispered. “It’s a warning… written in blood, I t’ink.”

Silence fell. Mary read aloud: “Whoever has found this treasure — beware. The Kraken will hunt those who take it from the land and, in a ferocious rage, destroy each and every one of you.”

Mary looked up, heart thudding, but Kitty only smiled — a small, knowing smile.

“If ye been in this business as long as I have — and that be many, many, many years, I promise — ye learn that not every warning needs heeding. Treasure worth having always comes with a bit o’ risk.”

“But—” Mary began, heat rising in her cheeks.

“Now, now,” Kitty cut in gently. “It be gettin’ late, an’ we need reach de ship ’fore de tide turn.”
Mary turned to Old Ebanks for guidance. He shrugged, eyes twinkling. “Would be a shame to leave de adventure so soon.”

“I agree,” George said, brushing soil from his knees. “And I’m starving. I’ve never even seen mango soup before.”

Mary looked down at the warning note again. Her stomach tightened. No one else seemed to care — the glitter of gold and the promise of adventure had already swept them away.

Everyone was tired, but they took turns carrying the treasure chest through the thickening heat. First Mate Blue — the blue iguana with the tricorn hat and a surprisingly bossy stride — kept urging them on with sharp flicks of his tail. Mary noticed how even George obeyed him without complaint.

At last, sweating and breathless, the jungle thinned. Leaves parted like curtains, and a rush of cool ocean breeze swept over them. Mary inhaled deeply… but the relief didn’t settle her. Instead, the salty air made her think of storms, of waves crashing, of something huge stirring beneath the surface.

And there, bobbing gently in the distance, was The Mango Mirage — a grand vessel with golden sails that shimmered like sunlight on water, and a hull carved from driftwood so strong it looked almost alive.

Kitty’s ginger fur glowed as she breathed, “There she be — me love and gateway to adventure. The Mango Mirage. Beautiful, ain’t she?”

Mary nodded, because it was beautiful. But the tug she felt wasn’t simple excitement anymore. It was tangled — part wonder, part warning. The note in her pocket seemed to press against her leg, as if reminding her it was still there.

The treasure chest was loaded into a small rowboat with Kitty, Mary, and Old Ebanks. George followed in another boat overflowing with chickens, their feathers ruffling in the breeze. The outgoing tide carried them swiftly toward the ship.

Mary should have felt thrilled. She was rowing toward a pirate ship — a real one. But every dip of the oars made her stomach tighten. The sea felt too wide. Too deep. Too full of unseen things.
When they reached The Mango Mirage, Kitty scampered up the rigging with the ease of someone climbing her own staircase. Mary followed more slowly, her hands slipping slightly on the rope, her heart thudding.

And then she stepped onto the deck.

The deck of The Mango Mirage was a world in motion. The sea rose and fell beneath Mary’s feet in a slow, steady rhythm, making the planks feel almost alive, as though the ship itself were breathing. Above her, the rigging creaked and sighed, ropes tightening and loosening with each gentle sway. Golden sails snapped sharply in the wind, sending shivers of sound racing up the masts.
All around her, the crew bustled with cheerful chaos: chickens clucked out orders, parrots squawked back their replies, and a pair of turtles polished cannonballs with surprising enthusiasm. Cool salt spray drifted across the deck, brushing Mary’s cheeks and carrying the sharp tang of the ocean. The hull groaned softly beneath it all, settling into its own ancient rhythm.

Footsteps thudded across the boards — claws clicking, boots stomping, wings fluttering — creating a lively, ever changing chorus. And somewhere high above, a bell chimed bright and clear, calling the crew to readiness as the ship prepared to set sail.

It should have been magical. It *was* magical. But Mary’s fingers drifted to the warning note in her pocket, and the paper felt warm — too warm — as if the words themselves were alive.

*The Kraken will hunt those who take it from the land…*

Mary swallowed hard. Everyone else was laughing, shouting, preparing to set sail. But she couldn’t shake the feeling that something in the deep was already stirring.

“Clucky Pete!” called Kitty to a proud-looking chicken, who saluted smartly. “Is the ship ship shape and ready to sail?”

“Aye, Cap’n,” replied Clucky Pete. “Ship all ready — jus’ say de word!”

“Henrietta Feathers!” Kitty shouted up to the highest mast. “What you see out dere? Horizon lookin’ clear?”

Henrietta Feathers — best lookout in the Caribbean — cupped her wings around her beak. “Aye, Cap’n, all is cle… no, wait! Something huge under the water — approaching fast!”

Mary’s stomach dropped. She locked eyes with Kitty, and a cold dread passed between them. The waters around the ship began to churn. Waves slapped the hull. Wind howled through the rigging. A vast shadow rose from the deep.

“Careful, children,” warned Old Ebanks, gripping the rail.

From the depths surged the Kraken — legendary guardian of treasure lost to the sea. Six burning eyes glared. Tentacles slashed. Enormous jaws snapped as it loomed over The Mango Mirage.
The chickens erupted into terrified squawks, feathers flying. “We doomed!” wailed Clucky Pete.

“Hold fast, me crew — dis ain’t no time for fear!” snarled Captain Kitty. “Load the cannons!” Her voice held only fierce resolve. *But resolve at any cost?* Mary wondered.

“Give the treasure back!” Mary shouted suddenly. “It belongs to the Kraken, not us!”

Kitty didn’t answer. Her single eye burned with defiance — a look that frightened Mary more than the Kraken itself.

“You love dis ship,” Mary cried, pushing forward into the wind. “An’ you love adventure too. You would throw all dat away for treasure — treasure you can’t even keep in your heart, treasure you’ll only stare at or spend? What about Blue, Henrietta Feathers, Clucky Pete… an’… an’ mango soup?!”

Something shifted in Kitty’s face — defiance softening into compassion, then sharpening into determination.

With a sharp nod to Mary, she sprinted to the treasure chest. Gripping it in both paws, she spun on her peg leg like an Olympic shot putter and hurled the chest straight at the monstrous guardian.

The Kraken caught it with ease — then lifted its tentacles high, ready to crush the ship.

“Now you jus’ wait!” Kitty barked, planting her paws on her hips, swagger sliding back into her voice as if it had never left. Not a flicker of fear crossed her face.

The Kraken paused.

“Eh-eh,” Kitty said with a grin. “Steady now. We was only returning your treasure. So off with ye — back to the deep where you belong. Go count your baubles again and again. Dere yours, after all.”

The Kraken rumbled — a sound that might have been a thank you — before sinking beneath the waves.

Silence fell as the sea calmed and the ship settled into its gentle bobbing.

Kitty exhaled slow, then stepped up to Mary and took her hands gently in her paws. “Bless yuh, Mary. You one o’ we crew now, true true. You understand what a real pirate want — de freedom o’ de sea and de adventure waitin’ out dere. But,” she said with a playful wink, “a touch o’ treasure sweetens de journey.” They both burst into laughter.

As Kitty went to reassure her crew, Mary pulled the warning note from her pocket. She held it up to the wind, and it fluttered away across the waves. “Thank you for de warning,” she whispered. “Whoever you were…”

Later, Pepperbeak — the colourful parrot cook — served his world famous mango soup, which soothed nerves and restored courage. George asked for third helpings, which Pepperbeak proudly provided.

As the sun dipped low, Captain Kitty One Ear led Mary, George, and Old Ebanks to a small wooden boat. “Back to shore wit’ ye,” she said, flicking her tail with pride. Henrietta Feathers squawked her farewell. First Mate Blue tipped his hat.

They rowed toward the sandy curve of Seven Mile Beach. When they looked back, The Mango Mirage had mysteriously disappeared as a dream that slips away with the tide. Only a whisper of sea mist and a shimmer of golden light remained.

“Was it real?” George breathed.

Old Ebanks chuckled. “Oh, my boy… in Cayman waters, all tings are real.”

And as they walked home, they thought of Captain Kitty One Ear, her brave and bonkers crew, and the taste of warm mango soup.
