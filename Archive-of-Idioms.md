## The Archive of Idioms

Captain Kitty One Ear adjusted her pirate hat and peered over the edge of the Mango Mirage. The sea below shimmered with secrets. Henrietta Feathers fluffed her plumage nervously, Clucky Pete clutched a half-eaten biscuit, and First Mate Blue - the ever-loyal lizard - tightened the bolts on their homemade diving bell: a leaky contraption made from a repurposed soup cauldron, a brass umbrella, and three mismatched teacups.
 
Kitty gave her best mischievous grin and announced, “Well now, listen up, me hearties. We 'bout to dip down deep where the sea don’t sing no lullaby. That bell jar o’ ours; she ain’t no beauty, and she leaks like a gossip in a fish market. But she’ll hold, if we hold steady. Now, I ain’t one for chasin’ gold or glitter. The treasure we seek be stranger than silver - tales older than tides, words what twist the world. They say down there’s a cave full o’ truths, where phrases be born and madness be bottled. And I tell ya, if we find the story behind ‘mad as a box o’ frogs,’ I’ll be satisfied for a lifetime. So, hold tight, breathe slow, and mind yuh tails—especially you, Blue. One swipe too wild and we’ll be swimmin’ with the jellyfish, not readin’ with the octopus. We dive not for riches, but for reckonin’. Let’s go find what the sea been whisperin’ all these years.”
 
They were chasing a legend: the Archive of Idioms, said to lie in a cave beneath the sea, guarded by the ghosts of forgotten phrases and the echo of linguistic rebellion.
 
Henrietta Feathers looked at the home-made diving bell and said, “Well, it’s… ambitious. I admire the craftsmanship, Blue. Though I do wonder if the umbrella’s meant to keep the water out or the panic in.”
 
Kitty gave the diving bell a hearty slap. “Blue, me sweet lizard, you’ve built a contraption that’s half genius, half madness, and all heart. She leaks like a politician’s promise, but she’s got character. We’ll ride her down, and if she don’t float back up, we’ll make a new idiom in her honour.”
 
Blue smiled at the comment, tail twitching with pride and mild panic as he tried to reassure everyone - “I reinforced the seams with seaweed glue and optimism. She’ll hold. Probably. Maybe. I brought biscuits just in case.”
 
The descent was slow, creaky, and damp. The bell jar groaned with every bubble, and Clucky Pete muttered prayers to the patron saint of poultry. Henrietta Feathers fluffed herself into a ball of nerves, while First Mate Blue stared wide-eyed at the swirling abyss, tail twitching with anticipation.
 
Then - light.
 
A flickering glow spilled from the mouth of a cave nestled in the seabed, like a lantern lit by language itself. The crew gasped as the bell jar settled gently onto the sand, and the hatch creaked open.

Inside the cave, the walls were lined with shelves carved from coral and driftwood, each holding books bound in eel-skin and squid ink. At the centre sat a desk made of polished shell, and behind it, the Archivist of Idioms: a monocled octopus with a velvet waistcoat and a voice like bubbling tea.
 
“Welcome,” he said, adjusting his monocle with a tentacle. “This is the Archive of Idioms, where the truth behind every phrase is preserved—however peculiar.”
 
He gestured to a humming contraption beside him. “This is the Oxygenator. It keeps the books dry and readable. I must return to the sea shortly, but you are welcome to stay and explore. Just… don’t touch the machine.”
 
Kitty nodded solemnly, her whiskers twitching with reverence. The crew dispersed, marvelling at entries like:

**“To butter someone up”** – Originated from a ritual in ancient toast-based diplomacy.

**“Spill the beans”** – A culinary accident that revealed a secret recipe for eternal youth.

**“Kick the bucket”** – involving a goat, a well, and a very unfortunate misunderstanding.
 
Clucky Pete waddled through the coral corridors of the Archive, his eyes scanning titles like *Feathers and Folklore* and *The Hen Who Knew Too Much*. Pete eventually chose to read the curiously titled *The Piratical Lexicon and Raidonomics: A History*, an ancient tome bound in gunpowder-stained parchment; its spine cracked like old rigging and its pages whispering with salt.

“It says here,” Pete clucked, squinting at the faded ink, “that the meanin’ of ‘Don’t miss the boat’ is to keep your aim steady and true when firin’ a cannon in a storm… so you don’t miss the boat you’re aimin’ for.”

Kitty looked up from the brittle pages of her own tome, one paw resting on a diagram of wind-swept pigeon with cold feet. “Aye, tis true,” she said, her voice low and laced with memory. “Ye gotta keep ya eye keen if ya hopin’ to land a cannonball straight through their poop deck. Miss the boat, and ye might be the one doin’ the poopin’, I tell ya that much.”

The torchlight continued to flicker against the salt-stained walls of the Archive, casting long shadows across coral shelves and barnacle-bound manuscripts. The oxygenator continued to hiss and clank, keeping the saltwater at bay as the Archive breathed its slow, ancient rhythm.
 
As Henrietta browsed a volume on spilling milk, Clucky Pete discovered a cookbook on cooking the books. And First Mate Blue, tail swaying with excitement as he flicked through a tome of going the extra mile to get a ball rolling in the heat of the moment, accidentally backed into the Oxygenator, which gave a soft a soft clunk and spluttered before… silence. The crew stared at the Oxygenator, eyes wide, not daring to think what Blue may have just done. The mechanical oxygenator sputtered again, its rhythmic hum faltering into a cough, then silence - but this time, absolute.

Henrietta Feathers started clucking nervously and tapped the brass casing with her wing. “She’s kaput, Cap’n,” she whispered. “Ain’t no air comin’ through.”

Clucky Pete flapped nervously. “We gonna suffocate in here, Cap’n?”

Kitty sprang into action, flipping switches, tapping valves, even whispering apologies to the machine. Sparks fizzled. But nothing worked. And the sea level in the cave started to rapidly rise…

Then Kitty stood, brushing parchment dust from her ginger fur, her voice calm but sharp as cutlass steel. “Right, me bredden,” she said, tail flickin’ with purpose. “At moments like this, I’m reminded of another idiom - and that be ‘Run for the trees.’ And them trees be on dry land, ya hear? So let’s get back in our diving bell, quick as you can!”

The crew didn’t wait for a second telling. They scrambled toward the submersible, breath shallow, hearts pounding, the Archive behind them groaning like a sleeping leviathan disturbed as the sea flooded in.

With heavy hearts and soggy feet, the crew quickly srambled into the diving bell and slowly ascended, the cave fading into the blue behind them. 

Back aboard the Mango Mirage, Kitty stood at the helm, staring into the horizon. She turned to Blue, who was curled - in slight embarrassment - beside a barrel of biscuits.
 
“Well,” Kitty said, with a wry smile, “Here’s a new idiom to add to the list: Lizards should watch their swiping tales.”
 
Henrietta chuckled. Clucky Pete clucked. And Blue, ever loyal, nodded solemnly and smiled - knowing that some tales are best remembered, and a tail is best kept between one’s legs.

And deep below in the ocean, fish entered the Archive of Idioms for the very first time - and began to read. Quite a different kettle of fish, some might say.
