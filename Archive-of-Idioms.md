## The Archive of Idioms

Captain Kitty One Ear adjusted her pirate hat and peered over the edge of the Mango Mirage. The sea below shimmered with secrets. Henrietta Feathers fluffed her plumage nervously, Clucky Pete clutched a half-eaten biscuit, and First Mate Blue - the ever-loyal lizard - tightened the bolts on their homemade diving bell: a leaky contraption made from a repurposed soup cauldron, a brass umbrella, and three mismatched teacups.
 
Kitty gave her best mischievous grin and announced, “Well now, listen up, me hearties. We 'bout to dip down deep where the sea don’t sing no lullaby. That bell jar o’ ours; she ain’t no beauty, and she leaks like a gossip in a fish market. But she’ll hold, if we hold steady. Now, I ain’t one for chasin’ gold or glitter. The treasure we seek be stranger than silver - tales older than tides, words what twist the world. They say down there’s a cave full o’ truths, where phrases be born and madness be bottled. And I tell ya, if we find the story behind ‘mad as a box o’ frogs,’ I’ll be satisfied for a lifetime. So, hold tight, breathe slow, and mind yuh tails—especially you, Blue. One swipe too wild and we’ll be swimmin’ with the jellyfish, not readin’ with the octopus. We dive not for riches, but for reckonin’. Let’s go find what the sea been whisperin’ all these years.”
 
They were chasing a legend: the Archive of Idioms, said to lie in a cave beneath the sea, guarded by the ghosts of forgotten phrases and the echo of linguistic rebellion.
 
Henrietta Feathers looked at the home-made diving bell and said, “Well, it’s… ambitious. I admire the craftsmanship, Blue. Though I do wonder if the umbrella’s meant to keep the water out or the panic in.”
 
Kitty gave the diving bell a hearty slap. “Blue, me sweet lizard, you’ve built a contraption that’s half genius, half madness, and all heart. She leaks like a politician’s promise, but she’s got character. We’ll ride her down, and if she don’t float back up, we’ll make a new idiom in her honour.”
 
Blue smiled at the comment, tail twitching with pride and mild panic as he tried to reassure everyone - “I reinforced the seams with seaweed glue and optimism. She’ll hold. Probably. Maybe. I brought biscuits just in case.”
 
The descent was slow, creaky, and damp. The bell jar groaned with every bubble, and Clucky Pete muttered prayers to the patron saint of poultry. Henrietta Feathers fluffed herself into a ball of nerves, while First Mate Blue stared wide-eyed at the swirling abyss, tail twitching with anticipation.
 
Then - light.
 
A flickering glow spilled from the mouth of a cave nestled in the seabed, like a lantern lit by language itself. The crew gasped as the bell jar settled gently onto the sand, and the hatch creaked open.

Inside the cave, the walls were lined with shelves carved from coral and driftwood, each holding books bound in eel-skin and squid ink. At the centre sat a desk made of polished shell, and behind it, the Archivist of Idioms: a monocled octopus with a velvet waistcoat and a voice like bubbling tea.
 
“Welcome,” he said, adjusting his monocle with a tentacle. “This is the Archive of Idioms, where the truth behind every phrase is preserved—however peculiar.”
 
He gestured to a humming contraption beside him. “This is the Oxygenator. It keeps the books dry and readable. I must return to the sea shortly, but you are welcome to stay and explore. Just… don’t touch the machine.”
 
Kitty nodded solemnly, her whiskers twitching with reverence. The crew dispersed, marvelling at entries like:
•	“To butter someone up” – Originated from a ritual in ancient toast-based diplomacy.
•	“Spill the beans” – A culinary accident that revealed a secret recipe for eternal youth.
•	“Kick the bucket” – involving a goat, a well, and a very unfortunate misunderstanding.
 
Clucky Pete waddled through the coral corridors of the Archive, his eyes scanning titles like Feathers and Folklore, The Poultry Lexicon, and Cluckonomics: A History. Then he saw it - an ancient tome bound in cracked eggshell parchment: The True Tale of the Headless Chicken.

He opened it with reverence, expecting a metaphorical explanation - perhaps something about chaos, panic, or poor planning. But what he found was far stranger. This phrase, it turns out, was literal.
 
In the 19th century, chickens were often observed to run, jerk, and move about after decapitation due to residual nerve activity. One particularly famous case involved a rooster in California who, after losing his head, wandered off and lived for seven days, fed by syringe and visited by curious townsfolk. The tale spread, and the phrase took root - not as metaphor, but as morbid marvel.

Clucky Pete blinked. He clucked. He sat down slowly on a pile of idiomatic scrolls.
 
“Well now,” he muttered, “I always thought it meant bein’ busy without purpose. But this… this is poultry horror. That rooster lived longer than my last nap.”
 
Henrietta Feathers, peering over his shoulder, gasped. “You mean it’s not about poor planning?”

“Nope,” Pete said, solemnly. “It’s about posthumous hustle. That rooster didn’t panic - he persisted. Makes you think, don’t it?”
 
Captain Kitty One Ear chuckled from across the archive. “So what you’re sayin’, Pete, is that even without a head, some folks still find a way to keep goin’.”
 
Pete nodded, eyes wide. “And that, my friends, is either inspirational… or deeply unsettling.”
 
Henrietta then found a volume on feathered idioms. Clucky Pete discovered a cookbook of metaphorical meals. And First Mate Blue, tail swaying with excitement, backed into the Oxygenator with a soft clunk...
 
The hum stopped.
 
The air grew thick. Pages began to curl. Kitty sprang into action, flipping switches, tapping valves, even whispering apologies to the machine. But nothing worked. And the sea level in the cave started to rapidly rise…
 
With heavy hearts and soggy boots, the crew quickly returned to the bell jar and ascended, the cave fading into the blue behind them.
 
Back aboard the Mango Mirage, Kitty stood at the helm, staring into the horizon. She turned to Blue, who was curled in embarrassment beside a barrel of biscuits.
 
“Well,” she said, with a wry smile, “Here’s a new idiom to add to the list: Lizards should watch their swiping tales.”
 
Henrietta chuckled. Clucky Pete clucked. And Blue, ever loyal, nodded solemnly, knowing that some tales are best remembered, and a tail is best kept between one’s legs.

And deep below in the ocean, fish entered the Archive of Idioms for the very first time and began to read…
