## Captain Kitty One Ear and the Hollow Creatures

Moonlight spilled like cool milk across the quilted folds of a four-poster bed, its canopy stitched with faded constellations and embroidered sea creatures, mid-swish. Captain Kitty One Ear lay sprawled atop silken sheets, her good ear twitching faintly with pleasure. A soft purr vibrated through her chest—a sound she hadn’t made since the Mango Mirage last dropped anchor in a lagoon shaped suspiciously like a sleeping serpent.

The pillows whispered her name. The duvet hugged her spine. She blinked lazily. This was comfort. This was warmth. And then…

Kitty’s eye snapped open! Claws extended with a metallic click. Her tail lashed once, twice. Where was her crew? Where was the Mango Mirage? And more urgently, WHO had dared to Shanghai her? Fury slithered up Kitty’s spine like a smoke-serpent as she leapt to her feet with the grace of a cat betrayed.

Her peg-leg thudded a sharp rhythm against the wooden floorboards, echoing strangely. Too hollow. Too still.

The cottage around her was charming - annoyingly so. Moonlight streamed through windows framed in ivy and cracked blue glass. A kettle sat whistling on an iron stove with no fire beneath it. Portraits of cats in ruffs blinked without pupils from the wallpaper.

Kitty hissed.

“Comfort,” she spit out, “dat be the sweetest snare, dressed up like a gift, 'til ya stuck.”

She padded across the room, each step deliberate and loud. Her peg-leg was not simply a reminder of past battles - it was a declaration of intent.

A glimmer caught her eye - a feathered quill resting on a mahogany writing desk. Next to it, a roll of parchment sealed with wax in the shape of a pawprint. But she wasn’t ready to read. Not yet.
She reached for the doorknob.

Her claws brushed it - wood, worn smooth. It pulsed once, faintly, as if sensing her touch. Behind the door, nothing stirred. No wind. No voices. Not even time.
And Kitty - brave, bewitched, and boiling with righteous fury - took a breath, narrowed her eye. And opened the door.

The door gave way to a hush wrapped in silver.

Kitty stepped into a garden, claws still unsheathed, expecting shadows or sea-glare - but was met instead by moonlight so soft it seemed to hum. Ancient trees arched overhead, their bark creased like forgotten sailor's maps. Hedges curved with uncanny purpose; shaped into whales mid-breach, octopi with curled limbs, dolphins whose leafy faces smiled eternally toward some vanished tide.
It was beautiful.

Too beautiful.

The flowers - each bloom kissed with silver haze - gave off aromas that tugged gently at memory. Lavender threaded with citrus. Jasmine soaked in salt. Kitty inhaled, against better judgment, and a purr teased the edge of her throat. Her tail swayed, lazy, and her claws slipped slightly back into place.

Kitty almost sat.

Almost.

Then came the shift. Not in sound, but in rhythm. Kitty froze.

Every tree, every hedge, every moon-drenched bush seemed to ripple - not wildly, but together. Coordinated. As though they shared a pulse. From behind each sculpted sea-creature, slow movement emerged. Legs, long and thin, ending in needle-like points, tapped the ground with deliberate softness. The creatures - slough-things, dream-hungered and hateful - assembled as one. Their mouths gaped but made no sound, and their eyes… their eyes were vast, glowing, feral voids.
Kitty hissed, spine arched, fur bristling like storm clouds caught mid-fight. Her good ear flattened.

She did not retreat.

But she understood.

There were too many.

Kitty spun, eye wide, scanning for any salvation - and the she saw it: a low wall, worn smooth with moss, barely knee-high but ancient. A boundary. A border. Maybe a way out. Maybe another trap.

Kitty grinned, her teeth flashing in the moonlight – she didn’t care. Any avenue for life and adventure rather than death or despair was a tonic of Life itself to Captain Kitty One Ear.

She ran.

The garden echoed with her peg-leg thud and the sound of claws scraping stone. Kitty’s breath hitched only once before she leapt - form perfect and fierce -as she cleared the wall in a single bound. Behind Kitty, the creatures surged, halted, mouthing silently, hungrily. But they did not follow.

Kitty landed hard, rolled, and rose with a grin that had teeth - she was not finished. Not yet. Before her stretched an immense stone wall, extending like a spine across the land - unyielding and directionless. One side harboured the path she had fallen onto; the other, a great canvas of flat, uncultivated fields bathed in pale moonlight. Not a tree nor shadow broke the view, only the long pull of horizon and silence.

She jogged forward, each step deliberate, ear perked and tail low. Her lone eye swept the top of the wall and the fields beyond, wary of pursuers unseen but imagined - ghosts of a chase she couldn't quite remember.

Time lost all certainty in the hush of this place. Whether moments passed or a forgotten hour, Kitty couldn’t say. But the road eventually led her to the edge of what seemed a village, though the word hardly suited the curious mishmash before her.

Buildings rose in fragmented collage: angular structures of glass and metal shimmered under moonlight, flanked by stoic stone cottages and crooked brick tenements. A modest mud hut hunched beside a narrow alley, its straw roof whispering of older ways. A sweeping curve revealed traditional Japanese townhouses, shuttered and serene. And in the centre - like a weary heart - stood an English Chapel, its spire bent and crumbling as if bowing to time itself.
“I wonder if dey got a bell,” Kitty murmur, her voice low and little strange in all the stillness. “Somethin’ to stir dis dreadful place.”

As Kitty walked the road beneath her shifted with each step - stone to tarmac to mud and back again - like it too was uncertain of its identity. As she approached the heart of the town, the buildings stirred. One by one, sounds rose: the creak of floorboards, the scrape of metal against metal, a sigh of shifting wood. Each structure exhaled its own presence. Not all at once, but close enough.
Kitty halted at the edge of a low brick wall, casually leaning against it. She inspected her claws, seeming unfazed. But her eye flicked like lightning - from door to window to rooftop - taking in every inch of architecture and movement. Her muscles remained coiled, tail twitching with readiness.
If this place planned to rouse itself, it would find her already awake.

From the buildings, figures emerged - shuffling, solemn, uncertain. Their garments spoke of many lands and many lives: a sari faded to pearl, a kimono drooping with forgotten grace, a denim jacket patched with flags, and pyjamas printed with stars. The moonlight softened their colours, draining vibrance, minute by minute, as if the land itself disliked memory.

Kitty narrowed her eye.

"Dat could be true?" she muttered. But she shook herself. No time to dream now, she scolded herself. Face de trouble head-on, like any real pirate who know what dey worth.

She cleared her throat theatrically, like she was centre stage, then called out with boldness and a dash of impish charm: “Ahoy, me breddas! Kinda late for strollin’ by moonlight… or ya throwin’ a bash and jus’ forget to call the real pirate?”

The crowd paused - still, breathless. Faces turned toward her, as if the sound of speech were something ancient, half-remembered. Some smiled faintly. Others wore expressions of puzzled yearning, as if searching their minds for what they’d lost.

A young woman stepped forward, eyes bright and curious. Her accent had the lilt of North Yorkshire, England.

“Hello. My name is Isabel,” she said, extending her hand.
Kitty met it with a paw, grinning. “Well met, Isabel! I be Captain Kitty One Ear - scourge o’ de seven seas and proud queen o’ de Mango Mirage!”

She dipped into a bow so dramatic, a few folks gasped.

“Last I remember, I been rockin’ easy in me hammock, swayin’ to de sweet lullaby of Cayman tides. Now look where I land... wherever here be.”

“I was asleep too!” Isabel said, frowning. Her hands twitched at her sides, as if trying to grasp a memory just beyond reach. “But you’re… you’re a talking cat!”

“Sharp eyes ya got,” Kitty purred, her tail flickin’ with pride. “I’s de finest feline pirate ya ever gon meet, believe dat.”

“But… that’s impossible. We must be dreaming!”

Without ceremony, Kitty poked Isabel’s arm with one claw.

“Ouch!”
“Did that feel like a dream?” Kitty asked, arching a brow.

Before Isabel could reply, a man in rumpled pyjamas shouted in panic: “Nous sommes sûrement morts !! C’est l’enfer !”

Kitty, seasoned in treasure raids on French vessels, replied with her best pirate-French: “Non, non! Nous ne sommes pas morts, mon petit pois. Mais nous ne rêvons pas non plus…”

“What did you say?” Isabel asked.

“Just that we’re not dreamin’, not dead… jus’ in one mad place wit' no map to name it.”

From behind Isabel, a small figure tugged on the hem of her cardigan. A child, no older than six, with curls like wild honey and eyes that blinked slowly, as if trying to wake up.

“I smelled flowers…” she whispered. “Before I came here. Like Mummy's garden at bedtime. And my teddy—he was snuggled right next to me…”

She looked down at her empty arms, the realization blooming like sorrow.

“Where’s my Mummy?” she asked, not in panic, but in that quiet way children ask when they trust the world to answer kindly.

Kitty stepped closer, softening her pirate swagger. “What ya name be, sweet pea?” she asked gently.

“Amira.”

“Well, Amira…” Kitty knelt and offered her tail, which Amira touched with curiosity, “I may not know where ya Mummy be jus’ yet, but hear me - Captain Kitty One Ear don’t let no one go missin’ without a proper chase. Not never.”

Isabel knelt beside Amira, her hands deft and gentle. She wrapped her cardigan around the child’s small shoulders and gave Kitty a quiet, reassuring nod - a silent message between shipmates weathering a storm. Kitty returned the gesture with the respectful tilt of her pirate hat. No words needed. A crew forming, in the face of the unknown.

A stocky man approached - his hands stained with flour, his cheeks ruddy, and his eyes full of both warmth and bewilderment. He wore an apron tied crookedly around striped pyjamas and smelled faintly of rosemary and burnt sugar.

“Scusi… I sleep with… my bella, yes? My wife. She have warm feet… always cold, mine.” He chuckled nervously, tapping his chest. “I dream—ah! New bread, for festival! Orange peel, almond, maybe lavender. Is good, yes?”

Kitty tilted her head and licked her lips at the thought of freshly cooked bread.

“But now… pfff.” He gestured vaguely around them. “The memory… it’s-a-fading. I remember my bella’s eyes, big like olives. And I had children… two? Maybe three?” His voice cracked. “What… are their names…?” He clutched his apron as if it might reveal the answer stitched into its threads.

Kitty stepped forward and placed a paw on his flour-dusted hand.

“We gon bake them memories back,” she said softly. “Or find the recipe for where dey run off to.”

Just then, a woman began to speak in Portuguese - her voice lilting with anguish and loss. Kitty didn’t understand the words, but the sorrow translated perfectly. Without hesitation, she embraced the woman, pressing her fuzzy head against the woman’s chest.

“There now,” Kitty whisper. “No storm blow forever. We here. You ain’t alone.”

And then came the slow tapping of a cane.

Out of the Chapel’s shadow stepped an elderly man with wild white hair and an academic robe fraying at the cuffs. He carried a satchel bulging with scrolls, books, and something that hissed faintly.

“I feared this,” he said in a gravelled voice, adjusting spectacles so thick they distorted the moonlight. “The signs, the dreaming displacement, the erosion of identity. We are in the realm between realms. A dream-tide. A place where forgotten things gather and Hollow Ones feed.”

Kitty raised an eyebrow. “And who might you be now?”

“Professor Aurelius Mandrake,” he replied, bowing theatrically. “Scholar of myth, mind, and memory. And you, dear Captain… appear to be one of the few immune to the Fade.”

“The Fade?” Isabel asked, standing with Amira in her arms. “And immunity to what?”

“To being unmade,” said Mandrake. “Each moment here chips away at us. Dreams, loved ones, our very names - bitten off like breadcrumbs on a breeze. You must act quickly. Before the Hollow Ones come.”

Kitty’s tail flicked.

“Well now, Professor,” she drawled, with a grin creeping in, “reckon it time we draw us a proper map… and find a spoon big enough to clobber dem Hollow beasties into next week.

“Memory is the key,” Professor Mandrake murmured, eyes gleaming with the eerie light that danced across broken cobblestones. “By taking our memories, the Hollow Ones trap us in this phantasmal realm — shadows of our true selves. But memory… memory will draw our souls back to our bodies in the real world. Make us whole again.”

A hush fell. Then Isabel broke it, voice wavering. “But… what stops them from drawing us back here, the next time we dream?”

Mandrake faltered. His lips parted, then closed again. No answer.

Captain Kitty scratched her chin, claws tapping a thoughtful rhythm. “You know,” she said at last, her good eye narrowing. “Best way to dodge gettin’ Shanghaied… be to burn de ship while it sittin’ quiet in de harbour.”

A startled silence. The Italian man stepped forward, flour still dusting his hands like ghostly gloves. “But this is no ship,” he said, gesturing to the town — the crooked buildings and twisted alleys shimmering like illusions spun from moonlight.

Professor Mandrake nodded gravely. “A thing can only burn if it’s made real. And to make it real… we must name it.”

“Aye,” Kitty said, her voice gaining edge and purpose. “Not just whispered. Officially. Like ink on a map of the Forgotten Realms.”

“How?” asked Amira, eyes round with wonder.

“All o’ dis,” Kitty said, sweeping her through the mist, trailing sparks where dreamstuff recoiled from her touch, “sprouted from our dreaming. The Hollow Ones lack soul. They mimic, pilfer, consume.”
Kitty stood taller. “So I’ll weave the Map, sketch the quill, baptize this domain.” Kittys voice fell to a whisper, like falling ash: “And when the map burns… the realm will crumble, fold inward… and will burn, too.”

Mandrake’s eyes widened. Isabel gasped. Amira clutched her satchel.

“But first,” Kitty said softly, “we need to get you home. And your memories…” She locked eyes with Mandrake, “they’re more than echoes. They’re the key. The map. The spark to light the fire.”

The moonlit town trembled as if holding its breath.

“Someone must go first,” Professor Mandrake said, his tone heavy with consequence. “Someone brave enough to break the barrier between this realm and the waking world.”

“I’ll not leave until Amira is safe,” Isabel whispered, clutching the girl close.

Captain Kitty One Ear stepped forward, paw and peg-leg planted, tail twitching with a flick of mischief and resolve. “Children first,” she said with a grin. “It’s pirate code. Treasure may glimmer, but heart always comes first.”

And so, Kitty and Mandrake began to guide Amira through a voyage of memory.

“Close your eyes,” Kitty murmured. “Tell us what you remember.”

Amira’s brow furrowed. “I remember… Mummy’s voice. She sings ‘Lavender’s Blue’ when I can’t sleep. I remember Teddy - he’s fluffy and always warm. He sleeps next to me. And… my night-light shaped like a rainbow. It keeps the monsters away…”

Moonlight shimmered. Then a sound in the distance, echoing, soft and dreadful: tip-tap, tip-tap… sharp points on cobblestone.

The Hollow Ones had sensed the stir of memory.

They began to climb over the moss-covered wall, their legs bending impossibly, mouths gaping in silent screams. They surged with slow hunger, heads twitching unnaturally. From behind Kitty, the French man whispered, “Les monstres arrivent…” his voice a thread of dread. But Kitty did not turn.

“Stay with it, Amira,” she said gently. “Follow de trail home…”

In the real world, a child stirred in bed. “I want my mummy!” Amira cried, as tears broke from her dream. Moments later, her mother rushed in, arms outstretched. “Bad dream, honey?”

Amira sniffled, nodding. “Uh-huh. There were monsters… but we were saved. A talking cat with an eye patch and one leg!” Amira’s mother laughed kindly as she cuddled her child and rocked her gently in her arms.

Back in the dream-realm, Kitty watched as Amira glowed faintly then faded from view, a smile frozen on her small face.

“She’s safe,” Kitty said, turning to Isabel. “All o’ you be my crew and I won’t let harm come any of ya.”

One by one, the memories rippled. The Italian baker clutched his apron, tears streaking his flour-smudged cheeks. “My Lucia… her laugh like bells… my children… I remember! Giorgio. Elisabetta. And the way she burned the focaccia just to make me laugh…” He vanished with a sigh and the scent of rosemary.

The French man straightened his collar, eyes sparkling. “Joie de vivre! I remember it—the café, the violin, the scent of rain on cobbled stones!” And then he quietly disappeared, gone, like laughter fading into morning.

Kitty knelt before the Portuguese woman, words faltering. Instead, Kitty kissed the woman’s hand, then wrapped her arms around her in a hug full of weight and warmth.

The woman gasped—and then whispered, "Mãe… minha irmã…" And she was gone.

Mandrake adjusted his spectacles one last time. “My books. My old chair. That Earl Grey waiting for me… Thank you, Captain.” He faded with the rustle of paper and the hush of a kettle beginning to sing.

Then Isabel.

“I won’t leave you,” she said, firm.

“You must,” Kitty replied softly. “Captain’s always last to abandon ship.”

Isabel breathed in deeply. “I remember… the children I’ve loved. Each name. Each bedtime song. And… Josh. Waiting for me. He promised a cup of cocoa and the next chapter of our life.”

She turned her gaze fully to Kitty, eyes searching. “But are you real? Will I ever see you again?”
Kitty’s eye gleamed, moonlight catching the edges of her tattered ear. She bowed low, dramatically, as if greeting royalty or bidding farewell to a lifelong friend. “If ya ever reach Cayman, light a lil fire by de sea 'round midnight. I gon find ya, no worry.”

Isabel smiled through tears. “I believe you.”

Kitty stood alone now, the Hollow Ones approaching fast—creatures of hate and hunger, legs stabbing the earth with eager rhythm.

Kitty adjusted her belt. Tightened her sash. And with one last grin, she muttered, “Now then, lads. Let’s see what burns.”

The one closest to Kitty reached out. It’s leg came fast - too fast for a dream, but not fast enough for Kitty One Ear. Kitty twisted, sidestepped, and slapped the creature’s limb with her tail. “You’ll have to do better than that, spindles!”

But although the Hollow Ones were slow, they were legion. Dozens upon dozens crept forward, their silent screams swelling in soundless unity. Kitty’s eye darted left, then up.

“The high ground,” she muttered. “Always take the high ground.”

She turned tail and ran - peg leg clanging against cobblestone - as a chorus of tip-taps echoed behind her. The chapel loomed ahead like a shipwreck breaking through fog. Kitty burst through its creaking doors and bounded up the spiral stairwell, each step reverberating with ghostly clarity.

She reached the spire’s window and paused just long enough to brace her footing. Then, she leaped.
Kitty landed on the chapel roof with pirate grace, claws gripping rotten wood. But horror overtook her triumph. The Hollow Ones weren’t bound by architecture. They clambered up the stone walls like enormous, broken insects. Their limbs bent wrong, their hunger bent worse.

Kitty closed her eye. She braced as she had during tempests on deck, feet wide, tail balanced. “Think,” she whispered.

Ancient maps, long nights below deck with parchment and dreams… she could feel them in her blood.

And then -in her paw - it appeared.

The Map of Forgotten Realms.

Kitty’s claws twitched. “The quill!” It blinked into existence beside the map, glowing faintly like moonlight caught in ink. Kitty sketched furiously. The eerie cottage. The garden. The moss-covered wall. The chapel itself. The town.

She titled it: The Liminal Hollows.

Thunder rumbled, though no storm stirred.	

And then, memory.

Salt spray. The crack of sails. Shouted laughter. Henrietta Feather’s trumpet snore. Clucky Pete plucking feathers out of his soup. First Mate Blue balancing a spoon on his nose. Pepperbeak squawking about mango etiquette. Kitty smelled sea and heard rigging tighten.

She didn’t fade - she returned. One breath, and she was no longer atop that crumbling chapel - she was curled in her hammock aboard the Mango Mirage. Still clutching the map of The Liminal Hollows.

Kitty leaped from her hammock and, map, in paw, padded onto the deck, moonlight tracing the ship’s elegant curve. Clucky Pete stood watch beside a brazier, flame dancing like memory’s echo.

Without ceremony, Kitty placed the Map and Quill into the brazier.

Pete blinked. “Cap’n, wha ya burnin’?”

Kitty watched the parchment curl and darken. “Just some old ting not worth keepin’.”

And the fire crackled on, brighter than before.


**Epilogue: Firelight and Mango Soup**

Two months had passed.

Isabel sat cross-legged on the sand, the fire crackling beside her, casting golden swirls across the shoreline. The waves whispered nearby, and behind her, the twinkling lights of her hotel blinked like reminders of practicality. You flew all the way from England, she thought. For what? A dream? A cat? You must be mad.

The island was stunning. The food divine. The hotel staff deeply confused when she’d asked if midnight bonfires were permitted on the beach. But now, with the time ticking past 00:30 and the stars indifferent overhead, Isabel sighed. Perhaps dreams were simply… dreams?

She stood to brush off the sand, half-embarrassed and ready to slip back into ordinary life…

“Isabel, me breddren, you made it after all!”

Isable turned. And there she was - Captain Kitty One Ear, silhouetted by the firelight, her hat tipped rakishly, her coat billowing like storm clouds wrapped in velvet. Her peg leg gleamed. Her eye patch winked with starlight. She was every inch the legend Isabel remembered - and more.

“I knew you’d come,” Kitty said, padding closer, tail swishing with approval. “Didn’t I promise? Now—come aboard the Mango Mirage. You’ll meet Henrietta Feather, Clucky Pete; even taste Pepperbeak’s mango soup, if he hasn’t burnt it again.”

Isabel blinked, her throat too tight to speak.

Kitty smirked. “And we’ll do all dis in time to get you back before breakfast. Unless...” She leaned in, eye gleaming. “...there’s treasure to be found.”

And indeed, there was - though perhaps not in gold or jewels.

Later, as the sun tiptoed up over Grand Cayman’s horizon, Isabel strolled back into her hotel, hair tousled with sea air and eyes sparkling like someone who’d glimpsed something impossible.

The night receptionist blinked at her from behind the counter. “Miss... yuh been out on dat beach all night?” he asked, his voice low and lilting, the Caymanian cadence wrapping the words in warm concern.

With a wave of good morning, Isable breezed past reception and towards toward the lift. “No,” she said, remembering the gorgeous taste of mango soup, “I’ve been on the Mango Mirage with Captain Kitty One Ear!”

The receptionist watched her go. As the lift doors closed behind her, he crossed himself solemnly and, gazing out to the beach and the rolling ocean beyond, whispered, “May the saints preserve us from de dread pirate, Captain Kitty One Ear…”

Later that morning, after a brief nap and a lovely coffee with oat milk, Isabel wandered into the quaint heart of George Town, where painted shutters creaked in the breeze and the scent of tamarind and warm fritters curled through the air.

While sipping her coffee near a quiet plaza, Isabel’s eyes were drawn to an old bronze plaque mounted low on a weathered stone wall, its edges softened by centuries of sun and salt. Isabel stepped closer. The inscription, half-swallowed by time, read:

***“On this spot in the year 1753, local legend tells that the dread pirate Captain Kitty One Ear, whose laughter rang through the night and whose stories sweetened the sea air, first sought gold and adventure while rescuing many a soul from danger. May all seekers find what they are bold enough to dream.”***

Isabel traced the words with her fingertip, heart thudding. She turned to ask a passerby about the plaque, but the elderly woman just chuckled, waved a dismissive hand and said, “Is best yuh don’t ask too many questions 'bout dat one, miss. But, some stories, dey more real than yuh think.”

And with that, Isabel smiled, tracing the engraved letters once more before continuing down the sun-dappled street, ready to make the most of her holiday on Grand Cayman; the scent of mango, mystery, and adventure thick in the air.
