"The Island of Shadow Maw"

Having won the Golden Chew-Toy from the Island of Giant Chihuahua’s, Kitty and her crew found themselves anchored off the coast of the next magical island. Kitty chose Henrietta Feathers, Clucky Pete, and First Mate Blue to go ashore with her. 

“Stay sharp, me hearties! Sure as de sea, danger an’ treasure both lie ahead!”, warned Kitty as they walked from the beach into a thick and tangled jungle.

As Kitty and her crew walked, the jungle tightened around them, the branches clawing at the sky like grasping fingers. The light dimmed; the shadows stretched. A hush settled in. It was too quiet. Even the wind dared not whisper.

“Cap’n, dis place don’t sit right wid me belly. Feels like somethin’ waitin’ to pounce!”, said First Mate Blue.

“Me got de sharpest eyes in all de seven seas,” said Henrietta Feathers. “But even me keep seein’ tings - one minute, dey dere. Next dey gone… then pop up somewhere else, quick as ya blink!”

Kitty squared her shoulders and said, "Aye, me hearties! I feel de danger lurkin’ in dis jungle, too – so keep yer eyes sharp an’ yer wits sharper!"

After a few more steps, Kitty spotted what looked like a shimmering pool in the distance which hadn’t been there a second ago. Kitty could hear a faint purring, hissing voice next to her ear saying, “Go to the pool Kitty… look into the pool…”

As Kitty wandered towards this ghostly pool, Henrietta Feathers and Clucky Pete saw two wooden doors appear in the middle of the jungle. Both Henrietta and Clucky Pete heard a faint purring, hissing voice which said, “Go towards the doors… behind each door you will find choices to ponder…”

First Mate Blue was alarmed as he saw Captain Kitty, as if in a daze, wandering off in one direction and Henrietta and Clucky Pete walking in a completely different direction. “What going on?” thought Blue. He was just about to call out to his crewmates, when a gleaming silver chalice appeared before him. A purring, hissing voice whispered in Blue’s ear, “Drink, and your mind will expand beyond the stars - you will be able to solve any mystery; out-think any foe. But in return, your voice will be lost forever…"

Blue thought about the choice laid before him – he could learn everything he ever wanted to know, but the price he would pay would be to lose, forever, the ability to talk. He could become the wisest creature alive, but never again use his voice to inspire his crew or make them laugh. What should he do?

As Henrietta Feather and Clucky Pete walked toward the mysterious wooden doors, both creaked opened up as if by magic. Through one of the doors, Henrietta and Pete could see a cozy barn, full of warmth, food, and safety - no storms, no predators, no fear.  Through the other door, they could see the open sea, where adventure thrives but danger lurks – where storms rage and terrifying monsters lurk beneath the waves. Which door should they walk through? What should they do?

A little distance from Henrietta and Clucky Pete, Kitty looked into the shimmering pool. She could see her reflection, but a reflection of who she used to be – whole and unscarred. The purring, hissing voice said to her, “I can restore your lost eye, ear, and leg. But there is a price! You must surrender the fire of adventure, Kitty. No more storms, battles, or treasure hunts - you would live a quiet life; safe but ordinary.”

Kitty stared at the pool. Her heart thumped. To feel whole again… to be untouched by battles and scars? It was tempting. For a moment, her paw hovered over the water. But then, NO! A pirate does not dream of the past. A pirate moves forward!

Kitty took one last look at herself in the shimmering pool and said, “"Nah, dis ain’t real. Ain’t no strength in pretendin’. Strength come from de battles fought; de scars earned. I choose a life truly lived over so-called perfection, any day. I know who I be - and dat’s all I need!" And, with those words, the shimmering pool vanished into nothing.

Henrietta Feathers and Clucky Pete looked through both doors once more. Clucky Pete started to walk towards the door showing the cozy warm barn, full of safety. Henrietta Feathers gently reached out and held Pete’s wing. “Pete, we be pirates, ya hear? De world is wide, de sea callin’. How could we trade adventure for a cozy roof? Freedom got risk, but risk be life itself!"” And with that decision, the two doors quietly shimmered and disappeared.

First Mate Blue picked up the gleaming silver chalice, tempted to drink the water of knowledge which shimmering like liquid moonlight. “Nah, man," Blue muttered, shakin’ his head. "What kinda wisdom be worth if I can’t talk, can’t share, can’t learn from me own crew? De best way to know tings is to talk wid people!” Blue slowly placed the silver chalice on the ground where it shimmered and disappeared.

Suddenly, Captain Kitty One Ear, First Mate Blue, Henrietta Feathers and Clucky Pete were standing together again on the beach in the bright sunlight. In front of them stood the strangest creature they had ever seen! Half jaguar, half serpent, with glowing emerald eyes and sleek obsidian-black skin covered in ancient symbols that shifted and shimmered like the ocean at night.

“I am the Shadow Maw”, said this strange creature. “I live ‘tween worlds and use tricks, illusions, an’ impossible choices to trap travellers, forever. Ye face me trials an’ come out free. Courage over comfort. Risk over certainty. A pirate spirit, through an’ through!”

“We be free Pirates, an’ free Pirates take what we earn!" Kitty grinned, her one good eye gleaming. "So, bring de prize - we done won it, fair an’ fierce!"

“Of course, na worries”, said the Shadow Maw. And with that, the Shadow Maw disappeared, leaving the prize – the Jewel of the Tides.

Kitty bellowed a horse laugh as she held the precious jewel. “Now why in de name o’ all de seas would I ever trade adventure for anything less?!”

Back on the deck of The Mango Mirage, First Mate Blue, asked, “What do you think we will meet on the next mysterious island, Captain?”

“I’m na sure”, replied a thoughtful Kitty. “But I do know that I absolutely love ma crew – and dat t’gether, we will always win!”
