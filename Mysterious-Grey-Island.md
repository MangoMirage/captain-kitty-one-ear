## The Mysterious Grey Island

Captain Kitty One Ear grinned as she held the Golden Chew-Toy from the Island of Giant Chihuahua’s in one ginger paw and the Jewel of the Tides in the other paw. Both items gleamed brightly in the golden, warm Caribbean sunlight.

First Mate Blue looked at the ancient map as the location of another island magically appeared.

“Avast, Cap’n!”, cried Blue. “We got a new heading an’ another treasure waitin’ ta be found!”

Kitty spun the captain’s wheel and The Mango Mirage cut through the rolling waves like a playful dolphin, her sails billowing like great wings catching the breath of the sky. The Mango Mirage didn’t just sail, she rode the sea, bounding over crests, dipping into valleys, and soaring forward with the rhythm of the tides. Foam kissed her wooden hull as she hummed along the wind’s melody, the ropes creaking in harmony with the pulse of the ocean. The Mango Mirage was not just a ship - she was alive; a fearless wanderer, a dancer of the deep, forever chasing the horizon!

“LAND AHOY!”, cried Henrietta Feathers as the new island came into view.

But this was no ordinary island, and the crew stared at each other, puzzled and anxious by what they saw. The whole of the island – the beach, the trees, the streams flowing into the ocean, and even the birds flying in the air – were grey. The was no colour anywhere, just a monotonous shade of grey. The island sat under the sun, lifeless and dull. Even the waves lapped against its shore without their usual sparkle. Trees stood in silence, their grey leaves refusing to rustle. No chirping. No buzzing. Just hush.

"Eh-eh, Cap’n… dis place feelin’ real strange, ya hear? We ain’t gonna turn grey too, right? ‘Cause I ain’t wantin’ to be no faded chicken!", said Clucky Pete.

“Only one way ta know, Clucky. Pirates don’t fret ‘bout safety - we take what comes, face it head-on, an’ make de best o’ it!”, said Kitty as she boarded a boat to sail to the island. 

Clucky Pete gulped, eyeing the colorless sand like it might swallow him whole. “Er… Cap’n… I be havin’ second t’oughts. You sure dis place ain’t cursed?" As the boat hit the shore, Clucky Pete closed his eyes tightly before jumping onto the grey sand. He slowly opened one eye, and then the other… “Hurrah!! Me not grey!” exclaimed Pete with delight.

Captain Kitty and First Mate Blue joined Clucky Pete on the sand and then began their walk inland, to see what they could find on this eerily grey island.

“What are you doing here?”, asked a small, gentle voice from behind them.

Kitty spun around quickly to see a grey fairy fluttering in the air. The fairy said, “Long I have waited. Long I have watched. And in all that time, the island lost its colours, bit by bit, until all that remained… was grey.”

“We come wid de Golden Chew-Toy an’ de Jewel o’ de Tides, ready to claim de third prize!”, explained Kitty One Ear. “De final piece be here - de key to unlock de treasure beyond imagination!”

“Ah”, said the fairy. “For the final piece, you must defeat the grey cat.”

Kitty’s fir bristled, as cats often do when faced with another cat. “And where do we find this grey…?”

But before Kitty could finished her sentence, a sleek grey cat with big, wide, grey eyes appeared from behind a tree and sat upon the ground, facing Kitty, First Mate Blue and Clucky Pete.

“Anyone who can outstare the grey cat, wins”, exclaimed the fairy.

"Ha! Dis be easy! Ain’t no cat alive dat can outstare me!" Kitty settled in, locking eyes with the grey cat, tail flicking like she had already won.

The staring contest began. One minute. Two minutes. Three minutes, they stared at one another…. and then the grey cat produced a feather from nowhere and tickled Kitty’s nose!

“Achoo!!” sneezed Kitty as her eyes closed automatically.

“The grey cat wins”, said the fairy.

“Eh? What kinda trickery is dis?!”, exclaimed Kitty loudly. “Dat ain’t fair - he cheated!”

“It was within the rules, I promise you”, said the fairy. “Now, who wants to go next?”

“Me! Me!” said Pete, jumping up and down. “Lemme go next! I ain’t got no nose to tickle, so dat grey rascal got nuttin’ to trick me wid!"

Pete started staring at the grey cat. The grey cat started to stare back. Two set of eyes, fiercely locked onto each other. One minute. Two minutes. Three minutes. And then the grey cat, from nowhere. produced a paw pilled high with corn and scattered the delicious plump corn in front of Clucky Pete. Clucky Pete couldn’t resist the temptation, and started pecking at the corn. Which meant he had stopped staring and so Pete had lost the competition.

“Oh, nooooo!”, cried Kitty slapping her forehead in despair. The grey cat looked smug, his wide eyes getting even wider.

“Alright, me turn now,”, said First Mate Blue as he took his place in front of the grey cat. The staring competition began again. One minute. Two minutes… and then Blue flicked out his long and flexible wet lizard tongue to gently lick the eyeballs of the grey cat!

“Ugh, ugh, ugh!! Lizard saliva!”, exclaimed the grey cat as he started to wipe his wide eyes. Of course, this meant that the grey cat had stopped staring and so First Mate Blue had won the staring competition!

“Hurrah!! We mash it up!”, shouted Kitty, Pete and Blue together as they high-fived one another.

“Now,” growled Kitty as she turned to the fairy, “I reckon ya owe us a prize, don’t ya?”

The grey fairy looked sad and said, “The prize is my wand. If you hold it together with Golden Chew-Toy and the Jewel of the Tides, then the treasure beyond imagination will be yours.”

Kitty held out her paw as if to take the wand. But then… she paused, paw outstretched as if she wasn’t sure what to do next. Kitty silently pondered if she was doing the right thing. Then, instead of taking the wand, Kitty lowered her paw and grinned wide. "Nah, man. I got me ship, de wind, an’ de seven seas. Ain’t no treasure greater dan dat. Me heart be full wid me crew - me friends. Nuttin’ could make me happier."

And so, Kitty gave the Golden Chew-Toy and the Jewel of the Tides to the fairy. “You can have the treasure beyond imagination… ya deserve it after waitin’ so patiently. Wish for whatever you want, ma grey friend.”

As the fairy took the Golden Chew-Toy and the Jewel of the Tides, colour started to flood back into her, and then into the land around her – into the trees, streams, and birds of the island. It was a beautiful sight to see.

As Kitty and her crew said goodbye to the happy fairy, First Mate Blue said, “Cap’n, dat was a mighty kind ting ya did.”

“Shh now, Blue - ya know I got a reputation to keep. A fearsome pirate can’t go soft, ya hear?" And Kitty flashed a charming grin, her one eye gleaming like treasure as The Mango Mirage sailed to new adventures.
