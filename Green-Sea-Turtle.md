## George and the Green Sea Turtle

George Ebanks kicked at the sand as he wandered along the beach, watching the waves roll lazily toward shore. He had always dreamed of leaving Grand Cayman - of escaping to somewhere big, somewhere exciting. London. New York. Anywhere but this little island. After meeting Captain Kitty One Ear, Geroge just wanted to sail away to new adventures.

"One day," he muttered, "I’ll be gone for good."

As George walked, he noticed something up ahead - a huge, ancient green sea turtle struggling in the sand, flippers pushing weakly toward the water.

George hesitated. Then, with a sigh, he crouched down and placed his hands under the turtle’s shell, helping him inch forward toward the lapping waves. Just as they reached the shoreline, the turtle let out a low chuckle. "Ya kind, boy," the turtle said.

George yelped, stumbling back. "What…?"	

"Oh, don’ be so surprised," the turtle continued. "Been talking for centuries. Jus’ most people na care to listen."

George squinted. "Centuries?"

The turtle nodded, his old eyes glimmering like polished jade. "I been comin’ back to Cayman longer than ya can imagine, boy."

George rolled his eyes. "Why bother? It’s so boring here."

The turtle chuckled again. " Oh, boy, ya wrong 'bout dat."

Before George could ask what the turtle meant, he felt the air around him grow eerily still. Time seemed to stand still for a moment and George felt lighter, somehow, as if the laws of physics were changing, becoming more unreal. The turtle began to glow, slowly at first and then getting brighter and more vibrant by the second. The shell of the ancient turtle was soon brightly illuminated with a shimmering blue-green light, pulsing like the ocean itself. The air around George shifted again. He felt weightless, his feet leaving the ground. And then, magically… he was underwater!

The undersea world stretched vast and endless before him. Sunlight filtered through shifting currents, casting golden ribbons over sprawling coral reefs. Vibrant, colourful schools of fish darted around him - yellowtail snappers, parrotfish, and stingrays who drifted like ghosts.

"What is this?" George gasped. “How can I even breathe underwater like this?”

"The magic of Cayman," the turtle said simply.

They swam deeper, gliding through caverns where glowing jellyfish pulsed like lanterns, past towering coral pinnacles where hammerhead sharks drifted silently.

Slowly, the turtle swam upward, surfacing. George found himself standing once more on the familiar sand; waves rolling before him, golden light painting the horizon.

"Ya say Cayman na special?" the turtle continued. "Boy, these waters hold more wonder than any city ya dream of." George was speechless.

Then, the turtle gazed into the long distance, over the sea, as if remembering past events. "Once, long ago, I swam these waters with a man named Columbus.”

George’s eyes widened. "You met Columbus?"

"Aye," the old turtle rumbled, eyes gleaming with memory. "I remember it clear as day - May 10, 1503. The day I saved Columbus from bein’ crocodile supper. See now, Columbus? He weren’t plannin’ to stop here. He was in a hurry, pushin’ toward Honduras, thinkin’ he could jus’ sail past Cayman. But last-minute, he an’ some crew decide to step foot ‘pon Grand Cayman, stretch dey legs a bit. Bad idea. Soon as dey touch shore, dem crocodiles was waitin’—big as boats, mean as the devil, ready to feast. I was swimmin’ along the shoreline when I see dem close in, jaws glistening like cutlass blades."

George’s eyes widened. "For true?! But I thought crocodiles was hunted to extinction on Cayman?"

“Na true,” said the wise old turtle, who then paused slightly as the memories of so long ago came back to him. “The crocodiles left the island because they lost a bet with me.”

“What?!”, George whispered, not quite believing what he was hearing.

“Aye. Magic run deep in Cayman, ya see. Back in dem days, crocodiles could walk ‘pon two feet, just like man. Had big spears, fancy headdresses, looki’ all kinda fearsome. Ain’t no small thing to face dem. Columbus an’ his crew? They was shook! Never seen such a thing in all their travels. First, Columbus rub he eyes, thinking he seeing wrong. Then, he bawl out, ‘Mamma mia! Questo è impossibile!’ Poor man, nearly drop-down right there. ‘Por la gloria de España, jamás he visto tal cosa!’ - he say dat too, callin’ on Spain itself for help."

The ancient turtle chuckled and then paused once more, before slowly continuing his tale. “Just when dem crocodiles was ready to toss Columbus an’ his crew in big pots o’ bubbling water, I step in, an lay down a challenge. Now, crocodiles? Dem full o’ pride. Crafty, cunning—think they smarter than any man, beast, or spirit. So I tell dem, ‘If ya so sure ya strong an’ swift, let’s see for true. Race me—race Columbus’ ship, La Capitana, all round di island. First one back wins.’ Well, dem crocodiles laugh, sure they got dis one easy. But ah, they never did know what real endurance be like!

"But come on now—no way a croc faster than a ship," George said, frowning. "That don’t even make sense!"

 “Crocodiles? Oh, dem fast, no doubt. Over short distances, dem twice as swift as Columbus’ ship ever could be. No lie”, said the wise old turtle. “But dat speed? It don’t last. Course, Columbus didn’t know all dat. He only ever heard tales ‘bout crocodiles moving like lightning. So, when he see dem sneering, laughing, sharp teeth flashing - he feel the fear creep up in his belly. ‘Oh, we gonna enjoy eatin’ ya later, sailor!’, dem crocodiles said as dey clanking their spears, licking their jaws, sure they already won.”

“Boy, I woulda been scared too, ya hear?” admitted George.

"Aye," the wise old turtle said, nodding slow. "I ain't shame to say it… I was scared too. Wasn’t sure if we could win. Dem crocodiles? Fast as lightning at first. Took off quick, streaking ahead of La Capitana, throwing jeers over dey shoulder, laughing up demselves. ‘Eat well tonight, boys!’, dey shout. Columbus? He jus’ hold on tight, watching dem pull further an’ further ahead. But as I hoped, dem crocs couldn’t keep it up. Too much pride, not enough patience. Little by little, La Capitana started gainin’. Tide shift, sails catch strong an’, before long, Columbus was ahead.

The turtle gave a smile at the memory. “We won. So dem crocs had to do what dey promise - pack up and leave Cayman. And Columbus? Well, he made a promise too. He never ever speak a word ‘bout talkin’ turtles and spear holdin’ crocodiles. Who woulda believed him anyway? But outta gratitude, he still leave me a gift by namin’ di island after me - ‘Las Tortugas’. It mean, ‘the turtles’."

"But why they call it Cayman now, an’ not Las Tortugas?" George asked, brow furrowed.

"Ah," the old turtle sighed, his voice like waves rolling in slow. "Truth be told, I did feel bad ‘bout sendin’ dem crocodiles away. Was their home, too, ya know. So, little by little, I work my magic, nudgin’ man to call dis place ‘Cayman’ - from the Carib word for crocodile. That way, even though dem gone, a piece o’ dem still live ‘pon this island."

George nodded, thoughtfully. "Must’ve been somethin’, helpin’ Columbus find his way."

The turtle smiled, eyes gleaming like jade in the dusk. "Aye, boy. An’ now, I helpin’ you find yours. Ya still think Cayman dull?" the turtle asked.

George looked out at the sea. The very same sea where centuries of history, wonder, adventure, and mystery had unfolded. And he smiled. "Maybe dis island ain’t so bad afta all."

The turtle nodded approvingly before he turned, slipping graciously and quietly into the waves.

George watched as the old turtle disappeared beneath the waves, swallowed by the shimmering depths. As the ocean stretched vast before him, golden light dancing across the surface, Geroge took a deep, contented breath. For once George didn’t just see water, he saw history. He could almost make out the billowing sails of Columbus’s ship, La Capitana, drifting ghostlike through time, carrying the echoes of those who had once journeyed here. Explorers, sailors, dreamers; people who had made Las Tortugas, Cayman, their home. What adventures had they lived? What dangers had they faced?

The questions surged through him like the tide; a thrill replacing the old restlessness in his chest. Cayman wasn’t something to escape, it was something to discover.

Smiling, George turned towards the island of Grand Cayman. For the first time, he wasn’t dreaming of leaving - he was dreaming of everything still waiting to be found.
